        <p>
        Making fajitas is one of the simplest and easiest recipes to make when in rush. A recipe that never
        fails to satisfy the pallet. A classic, juicy seasoned chicken, tossed with sauteed bell peppers
        and onions. To add even more flavor wrap in a warm torilla topped with avacado, cream cheese, or salsa.
        The possibilities are endless.
